# Field Campaign Explorer Backend 

This repository contains scripts to deploy FCX backend infrastructure to AWS Cloud.

Currently, this is work-in-progress and scripts are hardcoded to process files for GOES-R PLT Field Campaign. In future, these scripts will be refactored to make them modular and follow proper coding convention.

Following dataset processing scripts are available. More information about these datasets can be found at [https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/uso/ds_details/collections/goesrpltC.html](https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/uso/ds_details/collections/goesrpltC.html)


* ABI
* CRS
* FEGS
* GLM
* ISS LIS
* LIP
* LMA
* NEXRAD
* CPL
* HIWRAP
* NPOL
* DROPSONDE

## Local Run

* Create a sws credentials or export the following as the environment variables
    * AWS_REGION
    * AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* Each python script for every instruments of various campaigns are directly executable.
* Some campaign instrument also has a interactive python notebook to quickly check and test the validity of conversion before applying to all available datasets.

## Deployment

* Create a new EC2 instance or use an existing EC2 instance
* Create a file called env.sh and export following values
    * AWS_REGION
    * AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    * AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
    * RAW_DATA_BUCKET
    * OUTPUT_DATA_BUCKET
    * OUTPUT_DATA_BUCKET_KEY
    * ZAPPA_ROLE_ARN
    * SUBNET_ID
    * SECURITY_GROUP_ID
